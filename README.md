Aviation Safety Analysis: Minimizing Risk in Aircraft Acquisition
Dashboard Preview Example of an interactive Tableau dashboard for aviation accident analysis

Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to help a company entering the aviation industry make data-driven decisions on which aircraft to purchase. By evaluating accident trends, severity, and contributing factors, we identify the safest aircraft models to minimize operational risks.

Key Deliverables:
Non-Technical Presentation (PDF) – Business-friendly insights
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb + PDF) – Technical analysis with Python
Interactive Dashboard (Tableau Public) – Exploratory data visualization
GitHub Repository – Organized code, data, and documentation


Goal: Acquire the safest aircraft to minimize financial and operational risks

Key Business Questions:
Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates?

What are the most common causes of accidents?

How does aircraft age or manufacturer impact safety?
